# 🔧 Frontend Verification System Updates

## 📋 Summary of Changes

We've updated the frontend to work with the backend's new verification system that uses `requestId` instead of `contact` (email/phone).

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Patient Registration Page** (`app/signup/patient/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Now saves the `requestId` from the registration response to localStorage
- ✅ Also saves the contact info (email/phone) for display purposes
- ✅ Passes both `requestId` and `contact` as URL parameters to the verify page

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// OLD: Not saving response data
await response.json();

// NEW: Saving requestId for verification
const result = await response.json();
localStorage.setItem('verificationRequestId', result.requestId);
localStorage.setItem('verificationContact', data.preferredContact === "email" ? data.email : data.phone!);
```

### 2. **Verification Page** (`app/verify/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Added state for `requestId`
- ✅ Reads `requestId` from URL params or localStorage
- ✅ Updated API call to use `requestId` instead of `contact`
- ✅ Better error handling with specific messages for expired codes
- ✅ Clears localStorage after successful verification

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// OLD: Using contact for verification
body: JSON.stringify({
  contact,
  code: data.code,
})

// NEW: Using requestId for verification
body: JSON.stringify({
  requestId,  // Changed from contact to requestId
  code: data.code,
})
```

### 3. **OTP Resend** (`app/verify/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated to include both `contact` and `requestId` for future compatibility

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Option 1: Test with the HTML Test Page
1. Open `test-verification-flow.html` in a browser
2. Enter your email address
3. Click "Register Patient"
4. Check your email for the 6-digit code
5. Enter the code and click "Verify Code"
6. Verify you see success message with redirect URL

### Option 2: Test with the Full Application
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/signup/patient
3. Fill out the patient registration form
4. Submit the form
5. You should be redirected to `/verify` with the requestId in the URL
6. Check your email for the verification code
7. Enter the code and submit
8. Verify you're redirected to the main app

## 📊 What to Verify

### Registration Flow:
- [ ] Registration form submits successfully
- [ ] Response includes `requestId` and `contact`
- [ ] `requestId` is saved to localStorage
- [ ] User is redirected to `/verify` with proper URL params
- [ ] Success toast shows "We've sent a verification code to your email/phone"

### Verification Flow:
- [ ] Verify page shows the contact info (email/phone)
- [ ] Email arrives with 6-digit code
- [ ] Entering correct code verifies successfully
- [ ] localStorage is cleared after verification
- [ ] User is redirected to main app onboarding URL
- [ ] Wrong code shows error message
- [ ] Expired code shows specific error with "Register Again" option

### Error Handling:
- [ ] Missing `requestId` redirects to registration
- [ ] Invalid code shows clear error message
- [ ] Expired code suggests re-registration

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:
1. [ ] Test complete flow with real email
2. [ ] Verify localStorage is properly managed
3. [ ] Test error scenarios (wrong code, expired code)
4. [ ] Verify redirects work correctly
5. [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
6. [ ] Test with different email providers

## 🔍 Debugging

If verification fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `requestId` is saved in localStorage (DevTools > Application > Local Storage)
3. Check network tab for API response
4. Ensure you're using the code from the email (not a test code)
5. Verify the code hasn't expired (5 minutes)

## 📝 Notes

- The backend now sends real emails via AWS SES
- OTP codes expire after 5 minutes
- Each code can only be used once
- If a code expires, the user needs to register again (resend not fully implemented yet)

## ✅ Ready for Testing!

The frontend changes are complete and ready for testing. The system should now work end-to-end with real email delivery and proper verification flow.
